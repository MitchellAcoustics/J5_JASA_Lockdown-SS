# Lockdown modelling general notes and TODOs

## Modelling

**TODO**: Linear Mixed Effect model with pretty outputs for Tin / paper


**TODO**: Compute unscaled regression coefficients (maybe more difficult to do from a multi-level model?). ref. https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/stats1/x92.pdf
$$ b_k^{'} = b_k * \frac{s_{x_k}}{s_y}
$$
Can also find it a discussion here: <https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-generalized-linear-models-with-pyro-b80bc08d7b75>

**TODO**: Run a version with the output scaled as well? This should transform the intercept to equal 0
